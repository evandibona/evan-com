Hello, my name is Evan DiBona and I'm located in Kernersville, NC. I am new to the notary world and patiently waiting for my commission. In my life I've been fortunate enough to have had a wide array of experiences. From restaurants to landscaping, tourism to recreational vehicles. My intention is to take the best of what I've learned and to apply it to this new role, to provide an engaging and professional experience for my clients. 

<!--As of __ I am a commissioned Notary in the State of North Carolina.--> I take pride in my professionalism and ability to provide a service to my clients. All documents, regardless of the circumstance, will be handled with the utmost care, discretion, and attention to detail.
