Just came across this old note I had from last December:

> And now a break from the regularly scheduled programming of trying to start a business on a shoestring, to show you how to make gifts for 7 people on a shoestring.

Last Christmas seems like such a long time ago. At yet another financial low. I was in good spirits for a lot of it. Yet somehow the arrival of the holidays always seems to amplify the negative emotions one might already experience at the low point of the sun.
