Saturday!

Notary Application to submit, walks to take. 

Besides working on my Notary education, I'm keeping an eye open for land to purchase. Either an affordable long term lease or something I can get a loan for. 

I've got the bones of this site more or less how I want, but there is still plenty on my mind.
