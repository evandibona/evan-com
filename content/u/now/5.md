Surprised and (mostly) pleased at the [update][sos-letter] to notary law in North Carolina. 

Thinking it's time to return to my [CRM scripts][crm-git] and clear our any cob webs. 

"Patiently" waiting to hear from the Secr. of State's Office. 

I'm sure this isn't the last time I'll say this but university libraries are great. Even when they're kinda unremarkable at first glance, full of fluff and useless paperbacks, you still stumble across the occasional treasure. Today's score was some collected writings of Wilhelm Reich and a copy of *Selling to the Affluent.*

Weirdest part was that I didn't remember I had read the second one. I just found it on the shelf near other sales books and then as I read it, I slowly remembered the pdf I'd flipped through.
