Imagine an aging suburb. Families have grown up, others have moved out, those who remain are elderly. Sure, it's stable but it's slowly fading. 

What will revitalize this area?

Not sure, it's an open question. One idea that comes to mind is money. If this area can offer the same experiences as elsewhere, but more affordably, than I will happily move my family from the hip area to this sleepy neighborhood. Because ultimately I will be able to do more.
