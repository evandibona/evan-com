This is an idea that I can't quite put to words, even though I've thought long and hard about it. I believe it could save a community.

A place for the lost to seek out Food, Shelter, Gardens, Study, and maybe Spiritual guidance. Would be fantastic if it could be classified as a rehab facility so that the patrons would be protected from arrest. Certainly something to consider.
