This contract needs to be approved on 3 levels:

* Legally. It needs to conform with the fundamental laws of this state, statutory law, and the administrative code.
    * An Offer and Acceptance are the key elements of a contract.
    * The offer must be communicated, 
      complete, and accepted precisely. 
    * *Morrison v. Parks, 1913.* 
      “an acceptance is not effective unless it is
        a) absolute and unconditional; 
        b) identical with the terms of the offer; 
        c) in the mode, at the place and within the 
           time required by the offer.”
    * Be clear and precise and **stick to the agreement** 
      during its execution. If something must be changed, 
      get that in writing. 

* It needs to be, if not endorsed, accepted by the Secr. of State's office as not being in conflict with her formal (and maybe informal) code(s) of conduct.

* And finally, it needs to be accepted by the "court" of public opion. While I don't think I should flaunt what I'm doing on the facebook group, I do think that a small portion of these concepts should be public.
