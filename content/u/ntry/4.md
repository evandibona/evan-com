This contract needs to be approved on 3 levels:
* Legally. It needs to conform with the fundamental laws of this state, statutory law, and the administrative code.
* It needs to be, if not endorsed, accepted by the Secr. of State's office as not being in conflict with her formal (and maybe informal) code(s) of conduct.
* And finally, it needs to be accepted by the "court" of public opion. While I don't think I should flaunt what I'm doing on the facebook group, I do think that a small portion of these concepts should be public.
