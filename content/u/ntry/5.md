North Carolina Secretary of State, 

As I pursue my Notarial Commission I would like some clarity on a topic. 

In the 2016 version of your handbook you make it clear that Signing Agents are an unregulated profession. In a similar vein

What are the ethics and/or legalities of the following situations?

* Notarizing a document for anyone who has directly hired me.
* An individual approaches me with a contract to travel to his location, because I am a notary. I travel to him, complete a notarial act, and am compensated for my travel expenses.
