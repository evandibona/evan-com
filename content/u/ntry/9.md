The current statutory limit on notary fees is $5 per signature. Because of that I am only able to travel {{<notary-charge>}} to provide that service. I am often in Greensboro, High Point, and sometimes in Winston. If you have multiple signatures in a document, or multiple documents to notarize, I would consider travelling further. 

In addition to general notary work, I also provide various [document services](/v/dsvc). Where I offer my research and expertise to assist you in your goals. 

In an effort to explain everything it's possible that parts of this page may be unclear. Feel free to contact me with any questions or comments you have.
