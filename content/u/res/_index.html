      Ah, Briar Woods. It had its ups, it had its downs, and
      I forever learned the consequences of talking politics
      and religion too much.

    <p>
      Not particularly proud of my performance at these schools. 
      There were things in my life that distracted me from class,
      my mind doesn't take well to rigid academia, 
      and, ironically the one class that was related to my major
      (engineering) had an instructor that only highlighted all
      the negative parts of a career in engineering. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It didn't help my motivation. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Those experiences though, still teach me a lot when I'm able
      to contrast them with the methods I use today to effectively
      learn things. 
      As unfortunate as it was to face such a monumental failure,
      it has really buffered the pain of any future challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plus, there are many avenues to do the work I had 
      dreamed of doing when I was younger. 
      Life has a long way to go.

      Offered a management position at a dry cleaners fresh out 
      of high school. Tried my hand at printing t-shirts, found
      out that even after 8 months of practice, I still struggled
      to stay awake for the larger jobs. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2016 I gave into a suggestion to get a dime-a-dozen job 
      in Alaska. Turns out, it was exactly what I needed at the 
      time to get out and get a better perspective on life. 
      Keeping tours on schedule and handling whatever hospitality
      issues came up, kept my mind occupied and gave me a chance 
      to improve my public speaking.

      Currently I'm working in landscaping and hard scapes.

      Even though I just picked up a restaurant job, as a 
      challenge to improve my social skills, it ended up being 
      one of the more meaningful types of work I've done.

      All of my experiences were as a waiter. It really forces one
      to put his higher thoughts in the background and develop
      multitasking real quickly. While I can't say I'm a master
      organizer now, I was really bad before I worked in this 
      industry. Unfortunately the 2020 shenanigans really killed
      my interest in that industry. I'm hopeful that I'll get a
      chance to change that trend though,

      Ah good ol' sales. I'll add more at some point, but my 
      conclusion is that it isn't for me. Don't get me wrong, 
      the immense amount of study, self development, 
      extracurricular reading, and prospecting experiments 
      really added to my overall skills and knowledge in life. 
      Unfortunately, there is a certain edge that I lacked 
      as a salesman.

      That said, Crown Acura and Gander Outdoors were both great 
      places to work. Although I probably got lucky with Gander, 
      as most of that company is watered down, but most of my 
      coworkers were from the previously acquired company.

      I debated putting this on here, but I feel that it's a significant part of my skill-set. Though unpolished, I have absorbed quite a bit of programming knowledge over the years. In recent years I haven't studied very actively, but I have been working on some small projects for fun, most are on my 
      <a href="https://github.com/evandibona/">Github</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I've dabbled in Ruby, Python, bash, C, Go, and probably a few others. I've spent time with Assembly, Forth, Lua, and (this is a bit of a stretch) TI-Basic. 
    </p>
    <p>
      So, like a car enthusiast, I'm well educated and minimally 
      practiced. By no means would I consider myself a 
      professional, yet my working knowledge of operating systems,
      logic, electronics, and general programming makes me feel 
      at home in just about any information engineering context. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2015 I spend 3.5 months attending a "Coding Bootcamp"
      mostly working with a Microsoft stack that involved
      backend and frontend development. Honestly, it could
      have been a good course. The teacher was knowledgeable, and
      for the first half I was very excited. But towards the 
      end it devolved into piecing together bits of code like a
      kindergartener might slap colors together to make a picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came with the guarantee of a job, but the necessary 
      elements for completion turned out to be very vague and 
      nothing came of that experience. Still, it was interesting.
