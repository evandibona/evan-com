How much money is the service of a private library worth?

It's a tricky question. Even more challenging, is the question of how can I make a living running this type of business?

The math roughly works out to $20 per person. 100 membership slots, and a building which has 600 sq ft of space for members. Technically the math works out and works out well. Which pushes it off into a question of pragmatism. I have no idea how things will unfold when real people are filling those seats.

Now as for the vision:

Imagine being able to walk to the edge of your neighborhood to spend a day at the library. You have a book you want to do some writing on, a few legal questions to answer, and an obscure health book from 100 years ago you want to read. 

What if you could satisfy all of those needs in one trip to a local library? What if you had a nice desk to work from, with plenty of natural light? Legal questions? There's a shelf of American Jurisprudence, an ancient copy of Black's Law, and several hard drives of archives to dig through. Obscure health book? There's a copy about to be auctioned off on eBay, but the librarian recognizes its value and places a high bid with the library's own funds for that purpose.
