Hello, my name is Evan DiBona and I'm located in Greensboro, NC. In my life I've been fortunate enough to have had a wide array of experiences. From restaurants to landscaping, tourism to recreational vehicles. I am always trying to take these past experiences and use them as I move forward in life. 

Right now my goals and ambitions have narrowed quite a bit. Where I was completely lost when I graduated high school in 2011, I now have very specific purposes:

* A late night restaurant that prioritizes comfort, health, and affordibility. 
  Must operate as a PMA. 
* A [small library](/v/lbry/) for every neighborhood or geographical community. 
* More food businesses to elevate the health of our community. 
* Buying land and turning it back to the community in a way that yields a 
  small profit and a lot of benefits for others.
