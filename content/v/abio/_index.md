This section is tough for me to write, for a few reasons. When any man commits to writing a detailed and honest portrayal of his life, he has no shortage of shameful and embarassing moments which rise to the top of his mind. Perhaps with the exception of true sociopaths. Secondly, there is the challenge to properly judge what elements of my story are worth sharing. 

One cannot simply vommit out every detail of one's memory. That's not a story, that's a ledger of events.
