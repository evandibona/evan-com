In early 2021 I transcribed a early edition of *Zetetic Astronomy,* entirely by hand. It took a solid month of long typing sessions in between work and relationships. This project was done with the intent to bind them into hard cover books myself. Despite being able to achieve a couple of rough, coptic-stich copies, it wasn't the satisfying result I had hoped for. 

Perhaps in time I'll be able to revisit this project and outsource the binding. That said, there are plenty of copies now available on Amazon of this book and similar editions. 

So for now I'll leave my version here, in case anyone finds it pleasant to read.
