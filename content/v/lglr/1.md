As with many families in these times, my brother has been fighting a losing battle with the mother of his child. Without going into the grisly details, my conclusion has been that it's time to move these newer developments to Criminal courts instead of Family courts. So the following [Criminal Complaint](/doc/04.red.complaint.pdf) and [Affidavit 1](/doc/04.red.affidavit_1.pdf), [Affidavit 2](/doc/04.red.affidavit_2.pdf) are what I came up with. 

Hopefully they may be useful for others who have had their children taken by an uncooperative and abusive parent.
