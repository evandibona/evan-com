## My Readme

Mostly just putting this here for the benefit of my github repo. 

That said, there may be important concepts to mention here in order to remind myself and others of what I'm doing. 

I like what Scott Scheper is doing to illuminate the analog zettelkasten method of Luhmen. Some of that tree structure has informed this site. 

For the sake of legally keeping aspects of my life clearly defined, I am structuring this site to have pages which refer to my public life and to my private life. It is not my intention to hide things that happen in my private life, simply to differentiate them from any public office or public activity I decide to engage in. 

So the structure will roughly be:

```
evandibona.com
	/u	(Public)
		/cmty
		/ntry
		/now
	/v	Private
		/abio
		/febk
		/lbry
		/lglr
		/now
```

*Note: use 'hugo server --bind='*
